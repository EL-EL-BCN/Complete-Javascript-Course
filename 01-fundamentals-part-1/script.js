// We can use a variable multiple times in our code

// Conventions and rules for naming variables
// We use cammel case. i.e. the first letter of each word after the first is capitalised with no spaces. i.e firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth etc...

// Javascript has illegal variable names
// i.e. let 3years = 3; Variable names cannot start with a number. Variable names can only have letters, numbers, underscores and dolar signs.

// Javascript also has reserved keywords such as new. let new = 27; so they would also be illegal variable names. Another axample would be let function = 27;

// let name = "Jonas"; name is a reserved keyword but javascript allows variables called name but it may cause problems later on. Better to use firstName.
